hexo-theme-doc is a **documentation theme** for [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), the fast and powerful blog framework powered by Node.js. It differs from other Hexo themes by allowing you to present documentation—especially REST API documentation.

Created by JavaScript/Node.js developers, hexo-theme-doc capitalizes on Hexo's [extensibility](https://hexo.io/api/) and system of plugins for adding custom tags, customizing layouts, and processing multiple kinds of sources, which makes generating static websites simpler than other tools.

hexo-theme-doc's features include:

* A clean and responsive layout
* Search
* [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) integration, including [Swagger UI](https://zalando-incubator.github.io/hexo-theme-doc/usage-and-configuration/swagger-ui.html) support and the ability to generate [beautiful HTML API references](https://zalando-incubator.github.io/hexo-theme-doc/usage-and-configuration/swagger-to-html.html)
* Simple, configurable navigation, including for Tables of Contents
* Google Analytics
* Customizable logo and favicon

## <a name="get-started"></a> Get Started

Our [step-by-step guide](https://zalando-incubator.github.io/hexo-theme-doc/get-started.html) aims to get you running with hexo-theme-doc in five minutes or less.

For a deeper dive, check our **[user documentation](https://zalando-incubator.github.io/hexo-theme-doc)**.

## <a name="feature-roadmap"></a> Feature Roadmap

hexo-theme-doc is currently in development at [Zalando](https://jobs.zalando.com/tech/) and useful out-of-the-box to others. We welcome suggestions/feedback and [contributions](./CONTRIBUTING.md), especially on these planned features:

* More sophisticated control over navigation/automatic filesystem-based navigation (**community feedback priority**)
* Swagger to HTML
  * Make implementation more robust, and covering all edge cases (**development priority**)
  * Support for Swagger 3.0
  * Ability to fetch Swagger files from remote locations
  * Ability to provide request/response examples in an external file
  * Exclusion of APIs/operations from output
  * Markdown content support

For more info on our progress, visit the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) contributions.

### Environment Setup
To get started with hexo-theme-doc, you need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/). Then install `hexo-cli` globally:

```
$ npm install hexo-cli -g
```

Get the theme source and install the dependencies:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:zalando-incubator/hexo-theme-doc.git
$ cd hexo-theme-doc && npm install
```

Ensure that you can successfully run test and linting tasks:

```
$ npm run test && npm run lint
```

If you want to update the visual aspects of your front-end, we suggest using our [user documentation](https://zalando-incubator.github.io/hexo-theme-doc) site as a playground for previewing your changes. First, [link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) the theme package globally with:

```
$ cd hexo-theme-doc && npm link
```

Then get the user documentation source:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:zalando-incubator/hexo-theme-doc.git hexo-theme-doc-site
$ cd hexo-theme-doc-site
$ git fetch --all && git checkout gh-pages-source
$ npm install
```

> The documentation source resides in this repository as well but just on a different branch called: `gh-pages-source`

Now [link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) the theme package as a dependency (this will use your local version):

```bash
$ npm link hexo-theme-doc
```

Finally run the built-in server:

```bash
$ hexo s
```

Open your browser at http://localhost:4000, and hopefully you'll see the documentation site up and running.

### Test

Run tests with Facebook's [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) (currently the only testing tool compatible with hexo-theme-doc):

```
$ npm test
```

Coverage reports are generated at `target/coverage`. Sometimes you'll only need to run one test suite focused on a single problem; do that by running:

```
$ npm run jest -- <regexp>
```

`<regexp>` represents a Regular Expression, matching test file path(s)—eg. `npm run jest -- search*`.

### Lint

Lint the code using [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) (currently the only linting tool compatible with hexo-theme-doc):

```
$ npm run lint
```

To apply automatic fixes to your code, run it with the `--fix` option:

```
$ npm run lint --fix
```

### Compile

Use [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) and [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) to compile your JavaScript source and style source for the browser:

```
$ npm run compile
```

**!!! ALWAYS !!!** compile and commit distribution artifacts after updating Javascript and/or SCSS files.

### Release <small>(recommended workflow)</small>

Only the [maintainers](./MAINTAINERS)** perform releases. Our preferred workflow:

1. Bump version in `package.json`
2. Run `npm run prerelease`
3. Commit and push
4. Open a PR
5. When PR is merged, tag and push
